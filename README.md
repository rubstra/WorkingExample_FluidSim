% Fluid Simulation with Finite Element Method

% Based on the work of Philip Erler and Christian Hafner, a further
% development of the implementation made by Erler. Changes involves
% simplifications, new implementations (FEM solver on triqangle elements)
% and commenting the code with respect both to the performed Matlab 
% operations, as well as the theory.

%This is a working example developed for students studying fluid
%simulations and/or related topics. Many textbooks on fluid simulations are
%comprehensive for beginners, depending on your background. Understanding
%the theory could be challenging itself, and it often become more
%disturbing when this theory shall be put to practice. This working example
%aim at that gap, by presenting a code that solves a relatively simple
%fluid problem in both space and time. The code focus on describing what
%the different steps are performing, related to the theory, so that 
%in-depth knowledge of both the solution algorithm and mathematical
%programming can be gained.

%The example is related to the book by Robert Bridson, which is a very nice
%introduction to fluid simulations. Its called:
%               "Fluid Simulation For Computer Graphics"
%By reading the first small four chapters, and combining with this code,
%you should be able to get a quite good knowledge, step by step, both in
%theory and in practice.

%This example is developed for further developing, for this reason it is
%kept quite simple, so that it may introduce the basic and serve as a
%platform for new implementations and practice.
